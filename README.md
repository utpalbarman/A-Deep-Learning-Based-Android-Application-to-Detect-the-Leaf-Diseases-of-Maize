# Maize-leaf-Disease-Detection
  Leaf disease is a major problem in plant growth. Farmers should take the utmost care to detect the diseases of the plant. 
  But, early detection of plant disease may not be possible for farmers due to the lack of knowledge of the diseases. 
  Computer automation helps the farmer to detect the diseases of the plant. Here, MobileNet-based convolution neural network is implemented to detect the leaf diseases of maize. 
  The training and validation accuracy of the model is recorded in each epoch. 
  The best training and validation accuracy of the model with the training and validation loss of 0.33343 and 0.3047, respectively, is 93.23% and 93.75%. 
  After the successful training and validation, the model is loaded in android smartphone as an android application for real-time testing of the model. 
  The farmers can detect the diseases of the maize very easily using the app.
